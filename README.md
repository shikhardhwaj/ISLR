# An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R
The solutions to the exercises of the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R(ISLR)" in Jupyter Notebook.
ISLR is a very comprehensive and fluent introduction to machine learning in this case "statistical learning". 

The e-book version of the book is available by the authors website: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

There also very useful lecture videos for visual learners in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4OWDcPB1peiBXDfCSZ3h-w/playlists?flow=grid&view=1&sort=da

I don't add the data to hub, because you can reach them from the ISLR package with the following link in R: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html
Just execute the command >>install.packages("ISLR") in the R workspace.

Note: Click on the .ipynb files to see the codes and results. For using the Jupyter notebook please visit jupyter.org. Jupyter is a useful interactive notebook for Python, R and Scala
